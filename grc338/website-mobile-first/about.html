                <p>Three college best friends. Two passions. One goal. Cafe Clementine was established in 2015 when Georgia Dunn, Brooke Hollister, and Sage Duncan decided to combine their passions for healthy living and good eats. With the goal to empower positive living, Cafe Clementine offers a cozy atmosphere and a creative twist on all of your favorites. Our menu will get your taste buds dancing! We use locally sourced ingredients to make our eats fresh and flavorful. We want healthy living to be fun. We want you to feel energized. And, most importantly, we want to uplift others through positive experiences with food!</p>
