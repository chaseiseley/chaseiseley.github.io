                                <h3>Italian Fashion – Summer Season</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We love Italy anytime of the year but we especially love il Bel Paese in the summertime. What’s not to love about dining al fresco, spending long days by the sea and embracing Italian summer fashion? From the iconic Capri sandal and linen ensembles that take you from the beach to the city, to statement sunglasses and colorful frocks, Italian women excel at celebrating the season through clothes and accessories that are breezy and beautiful. Here are our must-haves for the summer season.
                                </p>

                                    The black one piece. Sophisticated, sleek, and sexy, a fitted black one-piece swimsuit is a timeless staple that’s perfect for l’estate Italiana. From spaghetti straps and open backing to rouching and colorful trims, fun details make a black suit anything but boring and you can add extra details with bright accessories. Swimsuits by Laura Urbinati are my go-to when I want to feel comfortable and confident and my current favorite is her “V One-Piece.” Originally from Rome, Laura spent much of her time living between Milan and California and creates 100% Made in Italy designs with inspiration from art and sea.

                                    Statement sunglasses. No matter the season, an Italian woman will never leave the house without her statement sunglasses so it’s important to have a few pairs to change out throughout the year. In the warmer months, funky shapes and colorful hues make even the simplest linen ensembles pop. I love vintage-inspired 1970s-style sunglasses handcrafted by Italian brand L.G.R. The camel tone combined with the perfectly rounded sky-blue lenses are the ultimate glamorous silhouette. If you’re seeking something a little less bold but still on trend, check out the classic metal with a pop of color or a chunky rectangular pair. The Mediterranean sun shines bright, but your statement shades will shine even brighter.                                </p>

                                    The Kaftan. Thanks to its versatility, kaftans have been one of summer’s most desired dresses for centuries. Not only are kaftan’s lightweight and loose in fit – the sleeved dress works perfectly for long days in the city, lounging by the pool, or exploring the countryside protecting you from the sun. This staple doesn’t take much thought as it’s the easiest item to throw on for a seaside lunch break or vineyard tour. I love kaftans that add a glamorous element, like a side slit, colorful knitting, or beaded detailing. Tulsishop, an artisanal brand based in Puglia, has some of my favorite handmade kaftans.                                </p>

                                    The mercati are traditional neighborhood street markets that take place in most Italian municipalities and are as ancient as the cities themselves.                                 </p>

                                    Italy is home to some of the world’s most famous cities, art, wine and beaches. Think Florence, Rome and Venice with their abundant Renaissance architecture and well-known galleries, Tuscany with its globally-renowned vineyards and the glamorous Amalfi coast with its see-and-be-seen vibe. While these places are an obvious draw for travelers, Italians themselves prefer to go on vacation to lesser-known areas.
