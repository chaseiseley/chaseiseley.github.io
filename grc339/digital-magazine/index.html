                                    We love Italy anytime of the year but we especially love il Bel Paese in the summertime. What’s not to love about dining al fresco, spending long days by the sea and embracing Italian summer fashion?

                                    Venice is one of those truly rare cities where famous masterpieces can still be witnessed in situ. You can experience the work of great masters without stepping foot in a museum, whether the paintings of Tintoretto in the marvellously ostentatious Scuola Grande di San Rocco or the altarpieces of Bellini in San Zaccaria. However, for a city bursting at the seams with monumental art and architecture, there are still countless museums worth dedicating your time to.

                                    Italy is home to some of the world’s most famous cities, art, wine and beaches. Think Florence, Rome and Venice with their abundant Renaissance architecture and well-known galleries, Tuscany with its globally-renowned vineyards and the glamorous Amalfi coast with its see-and-be-seen vibe. While these places are an obvious draw for travelers, Italians themselves prefer to go on vacation to lesser-known areas.

                                    The mercati are traditional neighborhood street markets that take place in most Italian municipalities and are as ancient as the cities themselves.                                 </p>

                                    Italian food is a surprisingly diverse cuisine. Each of the twenty Italian regions has a distinctive set of flavors, recipes, products, and ingredients.  In fact, the Italian regions were not officially united as a nation until the mid-19th century; therefore, each individual region has retained much of its exclusive identity.                                </p>

                                    The Italian language stems directly from Latin, just like other Romance languages like Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, French, Romanian, and other minority languages (Occitan, Provençal, Galician, Ladin and Friulan).                                </p>
